# workshop
This repository has been created to launch web pages for workshops. These include "Digital Humanities for a Medieval World: Public Digital Humanities in the Classroom" at the International Congress on Medieval Studies, May 8, 2025, and "Digital Humanities for Teaching: Mapping Viking Travels and Persons in Eirik the Red's Saga" at the Symposium on Medieval and Renaissance Studies at St. Louis University in June 2025. I may subsequently update it to add pages for other workshops as appropriate.
