# workshop
This repository has been created to launch a website for my workshop 'Digital Humanities for Teaching: Mapping Viking Travels and Persons in Eirik the Red's Saga' at the Symposium on Medieval and Renaissance Studies at St. Louis Unive3rsity in June 2025. I may subsequently update it to add pages for other workshops as appropriate.
