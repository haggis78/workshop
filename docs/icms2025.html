<h2>Looking at our data</h2>
        <p>The source of the data we are using is from the <a>Submission Strategies: The Irish Submissions to Richard II, 1395</a> project; I adapted material from Dr. Margaret Smith's <a href="https://github.com/msmith0913/submissionstrategies/blob/main/data/relations.txt">relations .tsv file</a> to fit the format requirements for Kumu. You can either upload .csv files to Kumu or paste in links to Google Sheets.</p>
        <h3>Nodes table</h3>

        <h2>Creating a network graph: Step by step</h2>
        <h3>Uploading your data</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In Kumu, click the green "New Project" button at upper right.</li>
            <li>Give the project a name. Description is optional. Tick "I'm not a robot" and then "Create project".</li>
            <li>Optionally, give your map a name.</li>
            <li>Pick the "Systems" template.</li>
            <li>Our graph is directional, so choose "Connections will be => Directed", then "Get started".</li>
            <li>You now have a blank graph. To upload data, click the green plus button at bottom center, and choose "Import".</li>
            <li>Start with your nodes table. You can "Choose file" and upload submission-nodes.csv from your computer, or paste in the link to a Google Sheet if that's where your data are. Then click "Import spreadsheet". </li>
            <li>You now see your data in "Import review". By naming our first two columns "Label" and "Type", we have already told Kumu what those columns represent; if you used different column labels, you would need to use dropdowns to select (at minimum) what column to use for Label. Click "Save import". You will now see all of your nodes.</li>
            <li>Now do the same with your edges table. You can "Choose file" and upload submission-edges.csv from your computer, or paste in the link to a Google Sheet if that's where your data are. Then click "Import spreadsheet".</li>
            <li>You will again see your data in "Import review". By naming our first two columngs "From" and "To", we have already told Kumu what those columns represent; if you used different column labels, you would need to use dropdowns to select what column to use for each, <i>even if your graph is non-directional or bi-directional</i>. Click "Save import". You will now see all of your edges.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Styling your network graph</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the slider icon at the upper right. This opens the control panel.</li>
            <li>Start with "Size by". Select "frequency". This will size the nodes according to how often someone appears.</li>
            <li>Next, click "Color by". Select "Element Type" to select that column from our data. This will turn the Witness nodes one color and the Submitter nodes another. You can also change the color scheme.</li>
            <li>Now let's spread out the graph so we can see better. Click "Customize defaults", go down to Layout Settings, and change Preset from auto to hairball.</li>
            <li>Try dragging nodes around; you'll see them pull on one another. To pin them in place, so you can drag them one at a time, go down to "Layout", and change from force-directed to "off". </li>
            <li>Once you like what you see, click "Save". If you want to start your styling over, click "Revert", and it will go back to the last saved version.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sharing your network graph</h3>
        <p>Once you have your graph in the form you want to share, click the project name in the upper left corner. Select "EMBEDS &lt; / &gt; " . Give it a title. Optionally, select "Include map overview in sidebar" and/or "Include current position and scale", then "Create embed / share link". You'll get both a read-only link and an html embed code. If using this as a classroom assignment, students can submit this to you for you to view and grade.</p>
